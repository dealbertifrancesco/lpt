\description{
Panel data on French communes affected by the Solidarity and Urban
Renewal (SRU) law of 2000, which imposed a 20% social housing target.
Communes below the threshold faced continuous treatment intensity
proportional to their gap from the target.
}
\details{
The sample contains 991 communes: 358 treated (SRU cohort 2000)
and 633 never-treated controls. Pre-treatment periods are 1993--1999;
post-treatment periods are 2000--2019.

Recommended usage with \code{\link{lpt}}:
\preformatted{
data(sru)
fit <- lpt(sru, "commune", "year", "outcome", "dose",
           post_period = 2019, pre_periods = 1993:1999,
           B = "calibrate")
}
